0) Origin
The theam of the game is not my original idea 
I had played a similar game game called "Squares"
which is same as this game which had squares instead of circles

1) Conditions
This Game is licensec under GNU's GPL
you should have recieved a copy of GNU's GPL
with this package , if not just google "GNU GPL"
and download a copy of it.

In addition to terms and condition in GPL
you have the following conditions , in case of any
ambiguities the following conditions get higher priority.

a) Do Not edit README file
b) Submit all bugs and Patches if any at my e-mail id


2) Game
The aim of the game is to collect all the 
green balls avoiding contact with red balls.
The pawn ball is controlled by user using mouse interface.
The pawn ball size increases as you start collecting more 
and more green balls making the game diffucult.


3) ToDo
Need to add speacial power balls like:
a) taking that ball reduces size of pawn
b) get 100+ points
c) One life more
d) We can add ball which causes negetive effects also
e) any more ideas are welcome
