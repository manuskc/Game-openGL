0) Origin
The theam of the game is not my original idea 
I had played a similar game game called "Squares"
which is same as this game which had squares instead of circles

1) Conditions
This game is free to use / modify and re-distribute
I take no responsibility of any harm caused by this piece of code, if so!
This was built while i was learnign openGL, and is far from perfect, you might expect bugs.

2) Game
The aim of the game is to collect all the 
green balls avoiding contact with red balls.
The pawn ball is controlled by user using mouse interface.
The pawn ball size increases as you start collecting more 
and more green balls making the game diffucult.


3) ToDo
Need to add speacial power balls like:
a) taking that ball reduces size of pawn
b) get 100+ points
c) One life more
d) We can add ball which causes negetive effects also
e) any more ideas are welcome


4) Contact
All your valuable suggestions regarding improvement 
of game are welcome .
